## About me
    I want to change my occupation and lifestyle. Therefore, my goal is to become a Frontend developer. I have no basic knowledge in the IT field. But I am not afraid of difficulties and am ready to learn new knowledge and devote all my free time to it. I believe that I will succeed. My most important quality is determination. I move forward like a tank, destroying obstacles in my path. Just a week ago I knew nothing about programming, and today I’m already writing my first code for this CV.
